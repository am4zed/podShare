#Inspiration
We were inspired by Facebook community groups such as "Meadows Share", and the idea of bringing local communities together.

#What it does
podShare connects like-minded people within the local community and allows them to share infrequently used or hard to access goods.

#How we built it
We built it with React, TypeScript and Sass.

#Challenges we ran into
A challenge that we ran into was that some team members were completely new to the technologies, and the time constraint was a challenge. It was hard not to get carried away with all the potential features. We spent 9 hours refining our idea and planning our approach, which meant we had less coding time.

#Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud of working with new technologies, and sharing the knowledge we have amongst the group. We are proud of our idea and that we got a decent prototype built in the time that we had.

#What we learned
Where possible, plan the idea before the hack! We also learned more about the circular economy and its importance. We learned how to work together as a group remotely, which we hadn't done before.

#What's next for podShare
We'd like to get together and work on the backend of podShare, hopefully fleshing it out into a more functional platform.

#Built With
react
sass
typescript

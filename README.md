# podShare #
<br/>
## Inspiration ##
<br/>
We were inspired by Facebook community groups such as "Meadows Share", and the idea of bringing local communities together.
<br/>
<br/>
## What it does ##
<br/>
podShare connects like-minded people within the local community and allows them to share infrequently used or hard to access goods.
<br/>
<br/>
## How we built it ##
<br/>
We built it with React, TypeScript and Sass.
<br/>
<br/>
## Challenges we ran into ##
<br/>
A challenge that we ran into was that some team members were completely new to the technologies, and the time constraint was a challenge. It was hard not to get carried away with all the potential features. We spent 9 hours refining our idea and planning our approach, which meant we had less coding time.
<br/>
<br/>
## Accomplishments that we're proud of ##
<br/>
We're proud of working with new technologies, and sharing the knowledge we have amongst the group. We are proud of our idea and that we got a decent prototype built in the time that we had.
<br/>
<br/>
## What we learned ##
<br/>
Where possible, plan the idea before the hack! We also learned more about the circular economy and its importance. We learned how to work together as a group remotely, which we hadn't done before.
<br/>
<br/>
## What's next for podShare ##
<br/>
We'd like to get together and work on the backend of podShare, hopefully fleshing it out into a more functional platform.
